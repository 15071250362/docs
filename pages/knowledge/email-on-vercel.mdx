## Email Hosting Solutions

Contrary to traditional web hosting services, Vercel does not provide email hosting to domains pointed to our platform. A separate third-party email hosting solution is required for your domains to send and receive emails. Your domains will need to have their DNS records mapped to the selected email hosting solution provider. For domains using the Vercel nameservers, you can manage your DNS records by using the [Vercel CLI](/download) and the [`vercel dns` commands](/docs/cli#commands/dns).

## Sending Out Transactional Emails from Deployed Apps

Vercel is a cloud platform for _static sites_ and _Serverless Functions_ only. We do not provide SMTP service nor allow SMTP servers to run on our platform. Please consider using third-party transactional email solutions like SendGrid and Amazon SES instead.

<Note type="warning">
  When migrating your domain over to our platform, please ensure all your
  mail-related DNS records have been correctly set to avoid disruption to your
  email service.
