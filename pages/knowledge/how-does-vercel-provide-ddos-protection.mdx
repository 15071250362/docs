Security is one of our top concerns at Vercel. JAMStack deployments are naturally designed to be far more secure than traditional server deployments
since it is architected in a de-coupled manner where the frontend is seperated from critical backend services like your database. While this inherent
protection exists. [Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) attacks are real threats that still need
to be addressed.

While our customers don't have to manage a thing, Vercel engineers work around the clock to monitor traffic patterns across all of our edges to take quick action
if any abnormal traffic patterns arise. We also have our own [Web Application Firewall (WAF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_firewall) to block any malicious IP ranges.

We never take a complacent attitude when it comes to security and always strive to further fortify the measures that are already in place.
