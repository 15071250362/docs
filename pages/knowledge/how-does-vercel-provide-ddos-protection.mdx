Security is one of our top concerns at Vercel. JAMStack deployments are naturally designed to be far more secure than traditional server deployments since it is architected in a de-coupled manner where the frontend is seperated from critical backend services like your database. Despite this inherent protection, [Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) attacks still threatern the performance and stability of your deployments and need to be addressed carefully.

Vercel engineers work around the clock to monitor traffic patterns across our infrastructures to product your deployments against abnormal traffic patterns, we also have our own [Web Application Firewall (WAF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_firewall) in place to block any malicious IP ranges. **By deploying on Vercel, your deployments are protected against most DDoS without additional setup.**

We never take a complacent attitude when it comes to security and always strive to further fortify the measures that are already in place.
