Vercel is currently testing the [Anycast methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anycast) for DNS and routing. This methodology allows those using a custom domain to verify it without requiring a change in nameservers.

## Verifying with A Records

To verify the domain, add the following record with your DNS provider:

- An A record with the value `76.76.21.21`.

If you followed the instructions above successfully, your domain will be available for use on any Vercel project that you own. All that's required is to add it to the project you wish to use it with.

<Note type="warning">
  If a CAA record is preent prior to the addition of the A record, this will
  need to be removed to allow Vercel to issue a certificate.
