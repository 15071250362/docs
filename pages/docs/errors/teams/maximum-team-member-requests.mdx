### Explanation

No more than 10 requests of users wanting to join a team can be open at the same time. In order to allow for more requests, the existing ones have to be approved or declined by an owner of the team.

This ensures the list always remains managable and protected against spam.

export default ({ children }) => <Errors meta={meta}>{children}</Errors>

export const config = {
  amp: 'hybrid'
}
