When using serverless functions, it may be necessary to pass environment variables, allowing you to specify potentially different behavior based on the environment it is running in.

Adding environment variables requires two steps, defining the environment variable as a secret, then making it available to your serverless function.

## Adding Secrets

To define an environment variable, you should use **Now Secrets**. By using **Now Secrets**, the data will be encrypted and stored securely, no longer directly accessible by anyone, and only exposed to deployments as environment variables.

Adding **Now Secrets** can be done with [Now ClI](/now), providing three options to work with them.

To **define a Now Secret**, use the following command:

<Snippet dark text="now secrets add <secret-name> <secret-value>" />

To **remove a Now Secret**, use the following command:

<Snippet dark text="now secrets rm <secret-name>" />
<Caption>Removing a <P.B>Now Secret</P.B> using <GenericLink href="/now">Now CLI</GenericLink>.</Caption>

To **rename a Now Secret**, use the following command:

<Snippet dark text="now secrets rename <secret-name> <new-name>" />
<Caption>Renaming a <P.B>Now Secret</P.B> using <GenericLink href="/now">Now CLI</GenericLink>.</Caption>

## Providing Environment Variables

To provide your serverless functions with environment variables, you should create a `now.json` file like the one below:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "VARIABLE_NAME": "@secret-name"
  }
}
```

To use environment variables at the build step of your app, refer to the [build step documentation](/docs/v2/build-step/#using-environment-variables-and-secrets).

To use the environment variable from inside the application you would need to reference it using the correct syntax for the language being used. For example, using Node.js, the syntax would be:

```
process.env.VARIABLE_NAME
```

Now, whenever the `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME` key is used, it will provide the application with the value declared by the referenced **Now Secret**.
