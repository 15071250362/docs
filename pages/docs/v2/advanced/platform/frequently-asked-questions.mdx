## Missing Public Directory

If your project contains a `package.json` file with a `build` [script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts), it is expected to output its static files into a directory named `public`, at the root of the project, when the `build` [script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) is executed.

You are seeing this error because your setup did not satisfy the above constraint.

To resolve this error, configure your project to place its static output files into a `public` directory, at the root of your project, when the `build` [script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) from your `package.json` file is invoked.

For example, this is how your `package.json` file might look:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "my-framework build"
  }
}
```

If you are seeing this error with a similar `build` script already, you may need to adjust the command to direct its static output files into the `public` directory instead.

Depending on your framework, the option for this might be called `--output`, `--out`, `--output-dir` or similar:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "my-framework build --output public"
  }
}
```

Once you have done this, the error will disappear since the output will be the expected directory, `public`.

## Missing Build Script

This error occurs when you have a `package.json` file with no `build` script defined, preventing Now from building your project.

To resolve this issue, add a `build` script to your `package.json` file
