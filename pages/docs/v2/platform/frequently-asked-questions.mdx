## Platform Version Detection

[<ProductShortName /> CLI](/download) will automatically upgrade your deployment to the latest platform version if you import a project or if your project meets certain criteria. In order for this to work, you must:

- Remove any Dockerfile.
- Remove the `type` property from your `now.json` file.
- Remove the `start` script from your `package.json` file.
- Remove the `server.js` file from the root of your project.

It is possible to opt out of this behavior by creating a `now.json` file with a `version` property.

If you are yet to upgrade to the latest platform version, please read our [upgrade guide](/guides/migrate-to-zeit-now/).

## Green Energy Policy

​<OrgName /> works with multiple cloud partners in order to provide services to end users.

The Serverless approach is an energy-efficient alternative to traditional servers because your code runs only on-demand.

For more information on our cloud partners' Green energy policies, we recommend viewing their documentation:

- [AWS Sustainability Timeline](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/sustainability/sustainability-timeline/)
- [Google Cloud Sustainability](https://cloud.google.com/sustainability/)
- [Microsoft Environmental Sustainability](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/sustainability)

## What can I deploy with <NameWrapper name={PRODUCT_NAME} />?

​<ProductName /> is best at deploying technologies that can be served over HTTP and distributed through our CDN network:

- Static websites and static generators ([Next.js](/guides/deploying-nextjs-with-now), React, Vue, Angular, etc)
- Code that renders HTML on the server-side
- API endpoints that query databases or web APIs and return dynamic data

In general, most popular technologies and languages already have [quickstarts](/docs/v2/introduction#quickstarts) or [guides](/guides) you can start taking advantage of today.
