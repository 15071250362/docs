To deploy on ZEIT Now, you need to create a **Project**. A Project is a logical structure that groups [deployments](/docs/v2/platform/deployments) and [custom domains](/docs/v2/custom-domains). Each project can be associated to a [GitHub](/docs/v2/git-integrations/zeit-now-for-github), [GitLab](/docs/v2/git-integrations/zeit-now-for-gitlab), or [Bitbucket](/docs/v2/git-integrations/zeit-now-for-bitbucket) repository.

## Creating a Project

You can [create a new project](/new) from the ZEIT Dashboard. You can either [import from an existing Git repository](/docs/v2/git-integrations) or use one of our templates.

## Deleting a Project

<Note type="warning" label="Note">
  Deleting your project will also delete the deployments and domains within it.
  If you have any deployments that are assigned to a custom domain and do not
  want them to be removed, make sure to deploy and assign them to the custom
  domain under a different project first.
</Note>

To delete a project, go to your project page and select the "Settings" tab.
