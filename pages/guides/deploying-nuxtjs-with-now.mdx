[Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) is an open-source Vue.js-based framework that provides multiple different rendering modes, one of which allows you to statically generate your application.

In this guide, you will learn how to create and deploy a Nuxt.js application with [ZEIT Now](/docs/v2).

## Step 1: Set Up Your Nuxt.js Project

The first step in setting up your new Nuxt.js project is to generate it with [`create-nuxt-app`](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/installation/#using-code-create-nuxt-app-code-):

<Snippet dark text="yarn create nuxt-app my-nuxt-app" />
<Caption>
  Initializing a Nuxt.js project with <InlineCode>create-nuxt-app</InlineCode>{' '}
  and <GenericLink href="https://yarnpkg.com">Yarn</GenericLink>.
</Caption>

When asked which rendering mode you want to use, select **Single Page App**.

With your Nuxt.js project initialized, move into the directory:

<Snippet dark text="cd my-nuxt-project" />
<Caption>
  Using the <InlineCode>cd</InlineCode> command to move into the project
  directory.
</Caption>

## Step 2: Deploying With Now

With your Nuxt.js application set up, it is ready to be [deployed](/docs/v2/deployments/basics/) with [Now](/docs/v2).

If you have not yet installed Now, you can do so by installing the [Now CLI](/download).

Next, change the build script in the `package.json` file to the following:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "build": "nuxt generate && mv dist public"
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  Adding a <InlineCode>build</InlineCode> script to the
  <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode> file.
</Caption>

You are now ready to deploy your application with **just a single command**:

<Snippet dark text="now" />
<Caption>Deploying your project with just a single command.</Caption>

Once the app is deployed, you will receive a deployment URL similar to the following:
<https://nuxt-4l3gekrti.now.sh/>
