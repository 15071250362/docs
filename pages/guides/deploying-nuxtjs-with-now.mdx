[Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) is an open-source Vue.js-based framework that provides multiple different rendering modes, one of which allows you to statically generate your application. 

In this guide, you will learn how to create and deploy a Nuxt.js application with [ZEIT Now](/docs/v2).

## Step 1: Set Up Your Nuxt.js Project

The first step in setting up your new Nuxt.js project is to generate it with [`create-nuxt-app`](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/installation/#using-code-create-nuxt-app-code-):

<TerminalInput>
yarn create nuxt-app my-nuxt-app
</TerminalInput>

<Caption>Initializing a Nuxt.js project with <InlineCode>create-nuxt-app</InlineCode> and <GenericLink href="https://yarnpkg.com">Yarn</GenericLink>.</Caption>

With your Nuxt.js project initialized, move into the directory:

<TerminalInput>
cd my-nuxt-project
</TerminalInput>

<Caption>Using the <InlineCode>cd</InlineCode> command to move into the project directory.</Caption>

With the following command, you can start a local development server to see your Nuxt.js app up and running:

<TerminalInput>
yarn dev
</TerminalInput>

## Step 2: Deploy Your Nuxt.js Project With Now

With your Nuxt.js application set up, it is ready to be [deployed](/docs/v2/deployments/basics/) with [Now](/docs/v2).

If you have not yet installed Now, you can do so by installing the [Now Desktop app](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/#now-desktop) which installs Now CLI automatically, or by [installing Now CLI](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/#now-cli) directly.

Next, create a [`now.json` file](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration) to instruct Now on how to build the project with a `build` step:


```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "name": "my-nuxt-project",
  "builds": [
    { "src": "package.json", "use": "@now/static-build" }
  ]
}
```

<Caption>

</Caption>

This `now.json` file achieves a few things:

- Defines a `version` property to ensure you are using the latest [Now 2.0 platform](/docs/v2/platform/overview) version
- Defines a project `name` that your deployments will be sorted under and known by under Now
- Defines a `builds` property as an array with one build step using `@now/static-build` to instruct Now to statically build the project and deploy the `dist` directory

Next, add a now-build script to your `package.json` file:

```json

"scripts": {
   "now-build": "nuxt build --spa"
}

```


<Caption>Adding a <InlineCode>now-build</InlineCode> script to your <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode> file.</Caption>

Your app is fully ready to be deployed to now:

<TerminalInput>
now
</TerminalInput>


<Caption>Deploying your project with just a single command.</Caption>

Once the app is deployed, you will receive a deployment URL similar to the following:
https://nuxt-app-f2ee248v9.now.sh/
