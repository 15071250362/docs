[TakeShape](https://www.takeshape.io/) provides instant, intuitive, adaptable, and collaborative services to power Jamstack projects of any size, shape, or complexity.

In this guide, you will discover how to create a [TakeShape blog](https://next-blog-takeshape.now.sh/), and deploy it with [<ProductName />](/).

## Step 1: Setting Up with TakeShape

Firstly, create a free [TakeShape account](https://app.takeshape.io/signup) and set up a Blank Project.

From the project settings page on the TakeShape Dashboard, create an **Author** model by selecting "Add Content Type", using "Author" as the title.

When settings up the Author model, add two widgets, **Single Line** with the title "Name", and **Asset** with the title "Picture".

Once you have added the required widgets, click "Create Content Type" to save the model.

Click the "Add Content Type" button again to create a **Post** model with the title "Post".

Add the following widgets with their corresponding titles:

- **Single Line** - "Title", marked as required.
- **Markdown** - "Content".
- **Single Line** - "Excerpt", marked as required.
- **Asset** - "Cover Image", marked as required.
- **Date** - "Date".
- **Single Line** - "Slug".
- **Relationship** - "Author", with **Relationship Type** set to "Single".

Once you have added the required widgets, click "Create Content Type" to save the model.

## Step 2: Adding Your TakeShape Content

Select the **Author** Content Type, then create an **Author** record using your name and select an image from the ones provided. If you like, you can use a custom image by uploading it to your TakeShape asset library.

Next, create multiple **Post** records, completing the fields where prompted. Make sure to choose the **Author** created previously, you can also use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for the **Content** field.

## Step 3: Set Up Your Next.js Blog

Set up a Next.js project by Initializing the [project template](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/cms-takeshape) and moving into the project directory:

<Snippet dark text="yarn create next-app --example cms-takeshape my-takeshape-app && cd my-takeshape-app" />

## Step 4: Adding Your API Keys

From the TakeShape Dashboard, create an API Key with the **Read** permission.

Using [Now CLI](/download), create [Now Secrets](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/env-and-secrets/) to securely store the API key, the project `id` from the TakeShape dashboard, and a preview secret.

<Snippet dark text="now secrets add next_example_cms_takeshape_api_key [your-takeshape-api-key]" />
<Caption>
  Adding the <InlineCode>next_example_cms_takeshape_api_key</InlineCode> as a <strong>Now Secret</strong>.
</Caption>

You can find your project `id` in the URL from the TakeShape dashboard, it will look similar to `a17a8efa-372e-4969-9267-55a9c35a0907`.

<Snippet dark text="now secrets add next_example_cms_takeshape_project_id [your-takeshape-project-id]" />
<Caption>
  Adding the <InlineCode>next_example_cms_takeshape_project_id</InlineCode> as a <strong>Now Secret</strong>.
</Caption>

Create a random string that can be used as a preview secret and add it using Now CLI. You can use a string similar to `MY_SECRET`, but remember to change it to make it unique.

<Snippet dark text="now secrets add next_example_cms_takeshape_preview_secret [your-random-string]" />
<Caption>

## Step 5: Deploying Your Blog with <ProductNameWrapper name={PRODUCT} />

<DeploySection meta={meta} />

export default ({ children }) => <Guide meta={meta}>{children}</Guide>

export const config = {
  amp: 'hybrid'
}
