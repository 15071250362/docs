When there is a new release of the [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download#now-cli) available, you will see a message appear in your terminal output when running Now, letting you know that there is a newer version.

This guide will take you through the process of updating Now CLI and how to stay up-to-date.

## Updating Now CLI

As of version 15.4.0 of Now CLI, you can **update Now CLI with a single command**:

<TerminalInput>now update</TerminalInput>

To update to the latest version of Now CLI yourself, you can use a package manager, such as [Yarn](#updating-with-yarn) or [npm](#updating-with-npm).

If you have not yet updated to a version that supports the above command, you can also use any of the following methods:

- Using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), for the latest Now CLI update, run the following command from your terminal:

  <TerminalInput>yarn global add now</TerminalInput>

- Using [npm](https://npmjs.com), for the latest Now CLI update, run the following command from your terminal:
  <TerminalInput>npm install -g now</TerminalInput>
